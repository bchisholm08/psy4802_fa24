# Final Analysis Project Repository

Welcome to the repository for the **Final Project** from 4802!
### Overview

This project and subsequent analysis is based on a subset of data from Dr. **Juraj Mesik's research** conducted in the APC Lab. While this is my final analysis for this project, it is 
really a starting point for further analysis of this data.
